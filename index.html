<h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>

<p>Amazon has come along and is drastically changing any industry it gets involved with. Due to Amazon's presence these retail chains have gone out of business:<br>

        <table style="width:100%; border-spacing:0;">
          <tr><td style="width:33%">Borders</td><td style="width:33%">Circuit City</td><td style="width:33%">Tower Records</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Musicland</td><td>Bebe</td><td>Claire's</td></tr>
          <tr><td>The Limited</td><td>Toys R Us</td><td>Wet Seal</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Sports Authority</td><td>Sport Chalet</td><td>And so on....</td></tr>
        </table>
	</p>
		
<p>And these retail chains are drastically changed and reduced their number of stores:<br>

        <table style="width:100%; border-spacing:0;">
          <tr><td style="width:33%">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</td><td style="width:33%">JC Penneys</td><td style="width:33%">Aerosoles</td></tr>
          <tr><td>The Children's Place</td><td>Footlocker</td><td>Guess</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Gymboree</td><td>J Crew</td><td>Macy's</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Michael Kors</td><td>Payless</td><td>Rue21</td></tr>

          <tr><td>RadioShack</td><td>Sears</td><td>Kmart</td></tr>
          <tr><td>GameStop</td><td>Office Depot</td><td>American Eagle</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Finish Line</td><td>And so on....</td><td></td></tr>
        </table>


<h2>Amazon versus Salon retail sales:</h2>
<h3>Why should Salon products be any different?</h3>
<p>Every salon brand is for sale on Amazon now and half of the brands are now selling directly via Amazon. Don't take our word for it, read what Eli Halliwell has to say here:</p>

<p>https://www.hairstory.com/eli/2017/07/31/open-letter-to-hairdressers-and-salon-owners/</p>

<p>He says "Anecdotal industry sources I talk to regularly confirm that product sales through salons have been declining every year since 2009 - even the biggest brands are seeing negative sales through the salon channel." And later "Interestingly, while retail sales through salons are down, overall prestige haircare sales are up. NPD just reported 13% sales growth over last year. That's because NPD measures sales to consumers through retail and online, not salon sales. Salon retail sales are negative and have been negative for a while. Consumers are still buying the first bottle in salon based on their hairdresser's recommendation, but they are replenishing online. It's just a massive change in consumer behavior. And now you can buy brands like Bumble or Oribe on Amazon prime or on the company's website or at Sephora or Ulta."</p>

<p>What is happening and what does he suggest: Sell off your inventory now!</p>

<p>https://www.hairstory.com/eli/2017/12/08/why-are-salons-dumping-their-retail-on-ebay/</p>

<p>So, all that inventory you bought is now selling much more slowly if at all.</p>
